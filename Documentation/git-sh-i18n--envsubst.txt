git-sh-i18n--envsubst(1)
========================

NAME
----
git-sh-i18n--envsubst - Git's own envsubst(1) for i18n fallbacks

DESCRIPTION
-----------

This is not a command the end user would want to run.  Ever.
This documentation is meant for people who are studying the
plumbing scripts and/or are writing new ones.

git-sh-i18n--envsubst is Git's stripped-down copy of the GNU
`envsubst(1)` program that comes with the GNU gettext
package. It's used internally by linkgit:git-sh-i18n[1] to
provide the `eval_gettext` fallback on Solaris and systems
that don't have a gettext implementation.

No promises are made about the interface, or that this
program won't disappear without warning in the next version
of Git. Don't use it.
